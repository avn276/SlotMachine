A slot machine game that implements core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures (lists, dictionaries) to simulate random game mechanics and calculate dynamic player winnings. 
It uses applied principles of modular design and user input validation to create a robust CLI game with a balance system, betting logic, and randomized slot spins using the random module.
